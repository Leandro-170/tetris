A tetris implementation made using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com). Made as a learning experience!

(learning experience = *to beat "I'm not a real programmer, i can't even make something as simple as tetris..." intrusive thoughts* experiment, in this context)

## tetris amazing,.
- No music
- No DAS or ARR, you have to press repeatedly
- Code sucks, also not commented
- Took longer than it should have
- 7bag system isn't even implemented properly

## How build to build how build to How
- Run `cmake`: `cmake -S . -B build`
- Run `cmake` (again): `cmake --build build`
- Run the `tetris` executable inside `build`
- asdfghjkl
